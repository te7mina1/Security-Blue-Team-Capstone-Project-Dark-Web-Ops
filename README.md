# Security-Blue-Team-Capstone-Project-Dark-Web-Ops

## Introduction

Dark Web Operations involve the identification, monitoring, and investigation of activities conducted on anonymized networks that conceal user identities and digital communications. Within Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), these operations are critical for uncovering cybercrime activities, tracing illicit transactions, and collecting digital evidence in a manner that preserves integrity and legal admissibility. In Security Operations Centers (SOCs), dark web intelligence enhances threat detection and incident response by providing early indicators of compromise, exposure of stolen credentials, and insight into adversary behavior. When integrated into SOC and DFIR workflows, Dark Web Operations strengthen organizational security posture and support timely, informed response to cyber threats.


## Pre-requisites

- Operating System(Mac/Linux)
- TOR Browser
- A basic understanding of Dark Web and its Operations

## Lab Set-up and Tools

- A computer running an Operating System(e.g Mac/Linux/Windows)
- Dark Web link to refer to
- TOR Web Browser


**NOTE: It is highly recommended to perform your investigation from a dedicated, isolated environment (VMs) and also Note-Taking**

## Exercise

1. What command is used in the Console to generate valid credentials? Provide the credentials, too.

2. After logging in, what are the titles of the three pinned posts seen on the website in ASCII text? Please place them in respective order.


3. Look at the Messages board. They are mentioning another illegal site. Provide its name.

4. A transaction log is mistakenly visible under the “Recent Transactions” section. Provide the customer’s full name, email address, and the purpose of the transaction.

5. It looks like the user PJ is hosting an illegal party. What city is this taking place and when? We could catch him there and shut down this entire operation.

6. What is the email of the user selling ‘stolen’ car parts?



## Conclusion
Practical, hands-on Dark Web Operations are crucial within the domain of Defensive Security and Digital Forensics. Successful engagement in this area demonstrates proficiency in monitoring, analyzing, and interpreting anonymized online activities linked to cyber threats. The skills gained—such as dark web intelligence gathering, threat actor profiling, and evidence correlation—are directly applicable to Security Operations Center (SOC) functions and Threat Intelligence roles. These capabilities support proactive threat detection, incident response, and informed decision-making, thereby strengthening an organization’s overall security posture.
